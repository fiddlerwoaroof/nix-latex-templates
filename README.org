* A Collection of flake templates for my projects

** A basic setup for lualatex with minimal dependencies: [[./lualatex-basic]]

A latex build with a relatively minimal subset of texlive as
dependencies so you don't have to wait for gigabytes of TeX
dependencies to download. Doesn't include a =flake.lock=, which
will be generated on first run. Usage:

#+begin_src zsh
  nix flake new -t github:fiddlerwoaroof/nix-templates\#lualatex-basic my-document
#+end_src
